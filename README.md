# Various CLI tools and helpers for MAC OS and/or Ubuntu Linux

To install script I prefer to use `~/bin` directory, so I can use it from any place in the system. Make sure that `~/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

**To install script**: `ln -s ./cue2flac.sh ~/bin/`

**To unlink script**: `unlink ~/bin/cue2flac.sh`

Or just use [VSCode Quick Actions plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=seunlanlege.action-buttons) while script is opened in editor. Actions are already predefined in [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json).
